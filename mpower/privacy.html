		<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Sage Bionetworks (“Sage Bionetworks, “we,” or “us”) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit biomedical research organization in the United States, created to enhance how researchers approach the complexity of human biological information and the treatment of disease.  
			<p>We have developed a mobile application (the “Parkinson mPower App”) to facilitate our Parkinson mPower research study (the “Study”).  The Study is designed to help Sage Bionetworks and research partners understand variations in symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.  The Study and the Parkinson mPower App are designed for users over 18 years of age, and are open for use or participation by anyone, whether or not he or she has Parkinson’s disease.
			<p>This privacy policy describes our collection of personal information when you participate in the Study or otherwise use the Parkinson mPower App, our use and disclosure of such personal information, and the steps we take to protect such personal information.  
			<p>By using the Parkinson mPower App or participating in the Study, you consent to the privacy practices described in this privacy policy.  
			<p><b>Registering for the Study through Sage Bionetworks.</b> 
			<p>In order to access the Parkinson mPower App functionalities, we ask you to create an account through the Parkinson mPower App.  To create an account, you must provide your name, email address and other general information about yourself to verify your eligibility.  We will inform you of the purposes for which we are collecting, using, and sharing your information in a consent document.  You must affirmatively consent to participate in the Study prior to creating your account.  
			<p><b>Information We Collect</b> 
			<p>In addition to the data we collect in registration, we collect the following through the Parkinson mPower App and the Study:
			<ul>
				<li>Data Imports.  The Parkinson mPower App allows you to import data to the Parkinson mPower App and the Study, including but not limited to voice recordings and data collected in connection with your performance of specified tasks while holding your iPhone, through sensors on your iPhone or certain wearable activity devices that allow import into your iPhone, as well as other data that you may have provided to Apple Health app separately or that may be available through other applications and data available through Health app.  You may choose not to import these data types and to still participate in the Study.
				<li>Health Surveys.  We will ask you to answer questions about yourself, your medical history, and your current health. You may choose to leave any questions that you do not wish to answer blank.
				<li>Standard Log Information.  We automatically collect standard server log information, such as internet protocol address and details of how you used the Parkinson mPower App (e.g. history of page requests such as uploading data or signing in and date/time of request). 
				<li>Other Information You Provide to Us.  We also receive other personal information you may provide to us, such as comments or questions you provide to us.
			</ul>
			<p><b>How We Use Information</b>
			<p>We use your contact information, including email address, to contact you for administrative purposes regarding your participation in the Study and your use of the Parkinson mPower App.
			<p>We use the information that we collect through the Parkinson mPower App and the Study to operate, maintain, enhance and provide all features of the Parkinson mPower App and the Study, to provide services and information that you request, to respond to comments and questions and otherwise to provide support to users.
			<p>With regard to our processing of personal information for the Study, our Parkinson mPower App and our associated services aggregate user-provided and user-generated information, including personal information.  We separate your account information (e.g., name or email address) from your Study data (including survey response and tasks measurements, and including, e.g., height, body weight, blood pressures, heart rates, medications, voice recordings, and survey answers) and combine your coded Study data (without your name) with those of other Study participants for research and analysis as described below under “How We Disclose Information.” 
			<p>We use standard log files and other automatically-collected usage data to:  (i) personalize the Parkinson App and the Study, such as by remembering information so that it does not need to be re-entered; (ii) monitor and analyze the Parkinson mPower App and the Study; (iii) monitor aggregate mPower App usage metrics; and (iv) track your activities on the Parkinson mPower App and in the Study.
			<p><b>How We Disclose Information</b>
			<p>Except as described in this privacy policy, we will not sell, rent, or lease your contact information, and will not disclose your information that we collect through the Parkinson mPower App and the Study to third parties without your consent.  We may disclose information to third parties if you consent to us doing so, as well as in the following circumstances:
			<ul>
				<li>We may work with third party service providers to provide maintenance, analysis, and other services for us.  These third parties may have access to or process your information as part of providing those services for us.  We take steps to limit the information provided to these service providers to that which is reasonably necessary for them to perform their functions, and we require them to agree to maintain the confidentiality of such information.
				<li>We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws, in response to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena or warrant, or to otherwise cooperate with law enforcement or other governmental agencies. 
				<li>We also reserve the right to disclose your information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to (i) take precautions against liability, (ii) protect ourselves or others from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses or activity, (iii) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, (iv) protect the security or integrity of the Parkinson mPower App and the Study and any facilities or equipment used to make the Parkinson mPower App or Study available, or (v) protect our property or other legal rights (including, but not limited to, enforcement of our agreements), or the rights, property, or safety of others.
				<li>Information about our users, including personal information, may be disclosed and otherwise transferred to an acquirer, successor, or assignee as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of assets, or similar transaction, or in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which information is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business assets.
				<li>As described above in the “How We Use Information” section, we will combine your Study data, including survey response and tasks measurements, with those of other Study participants. The combined data will be transferred to Synapse, a computational research platform, for analysis.  Researchers from the Study team and its partners accessing data through Synapse will analyze the data and report findings back to the community through blog or scientific publications.  This Study gives you the option to share your coded Study data more broadly, with other researchers worldwide, for use in this research and beyond to benefit future research.  If you choose to share your data broadly, your coded data (without your contact information) will be added to a shared Study dataset on Synapse and will be made available to qualified researchers who are registered Synapse users and who agree to using the data in an ethical manner, to do no harm and not attempt to re-identify or re-contact you unless you have chosen to allow them to do so.
			</ul> 
			<p><b>How is my Health app data handled?</b>
			You have the option to share data from your mobile device’s iOS Health app with the App.  Unless you agree to share your data through and with the App, you will not be able to participate in the study.  Once you agree to share your data through and with the App, such data become covered by this Privacy Policy. 
			The App was developed using Apple’s HealthKit framework and thus complies with Apple’s development guidelines. To view these guidelines, go to https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#healthkit.</p>
			<p><b>Do Not Track</b>
			<p>We do not track our Parkinson mPower App visitors over time and across third party websites or online services to provide targeted advertising, and we do not specifically respond to Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals. 
			<p><b>Data Security / Anonymity</b>
			<p>Sage Bionetworks uses certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards that are designed to improve the integrity and security of personal information that we collect and maintain, including by helping guard against loss, theft and misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.  We cannot, however, guarantee the security of personal information or other information transmitted to us through the Parkinson mPower App or the Study, or that such information will not be accessed by unauthorized persons.  Hacking or other activities outside of the procedures authorized by the Study may result in unauthorized acquisition of, or access to, such personal information and other information.  
			<p>Additionally, although we take steps to remove personal information that reasonably can be used to identify you directly, such as name or telephone number, from the research study data, experts in re-identification may be able to reverse our processes and/or attempt to re-identify you if given sufficient cross-reference information.  Total anonymity cannot be guaranteed.
			<p><b>Choice and Access</b>
			<p>You are able to review certain personal information we have collected through your use of the Parkinson mPower App and participation in the Study within the App.  If you wish to access or amend any other Personal Information we hold about you, you may contact us at privacypolicy@sagebase.org.  Please note that while any changes you make will be reflected in active user databases within a reasonable period of time, we may retain all information you submit for backups, archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, satisfaction of legal obligations, or where we otherwise reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so.
			<p>If you would like to withdraw from the Study, you may do so within the Parkinson mPower App by clicking on the “withdraw” link in your profile page.  You also may contact us at PDApp@sagebase.org to withdraw from the Study.
			<p>Please note that if you withdraw from the Study, we will stop collecting new data from you, but the coded study data that you have already provided will already have been distributed and will not be able to be destroyed or deleted.
			<p>If you have questions about your ability to access or delete your personal information, or would like to request additional information, please contact privacypolicy@sagebase.org.
			<p><b>Cross-Border Transfer of Your Information</b>
			<p>Although you may access the Parkinson mPower App or participate in the study from a location outside of the United States, any personal information collected by us in connection with the Parkinson mPower App or the study may be transferred to, processed, and stored within the United States.  Also, we may transfer your data from the U.S. to other countries or regions in connection with storage and processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and operating the Parkinson mPower App and the Study.  By using the Parkinson mPower App or participating in the Study, you consent to the transfer of information to countries outside of your country of residence, which may have different personal data protection rules than in your country.
			<p><b>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</b>
			<p>We may change this privacy policy from time to time.  Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.  In the event that any changes to this privacy policy materially alter your rights or obligations under this privacy policy, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the change. For example, we may send a message to your email address, if we have one on file, or generate a pop-up or similar notification when you access the Parkinson mPower App or the Study for the first time after such material changes are made. Your continued use of the Parkinson mPower App or the Study after the revised privacy policy has become effective indicates that you have read, understood and agreed to the then-current version of this privacy policy.
