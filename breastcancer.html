		<h3>About this Study</h3>
		<div class="content">
			<p>How can we better manage the symptoms after breast cancer treatment together?  Sage Bionetworks, 
			a 501(c)(3) nonprofit research organization, invites you to volunteer in a new approach to monitor 
			health in women using mobile apps. <b>Share the Journey:</b> Mind, Body and Wellness after breast cancer 
			is a clinical study that aims to understand the symptoms after breast cancer treatment, why these 
			symptoms vary over time, and what can be done to improve them.</p>
			
			<p><a class="learn-more" data-for="more-about">Learn More</a></p>
			
			<p class="more-text" id="more-about">New technologies allow people to record and track their health 
			and symptoms in real time. <b>Share the Journey</b> will use surveys and phone sensor data to collect 
			and track five common symptoms that can persist after breast cancer treatment: fatigue, mood and 
			cognitive changes, sleep disturbances, and reduction in exercise.   Some participants will be invited 
			to keep a health diary. The app will allow you to track these symptoms and others of your choosing, 
			review trends, and provide your insights to researchers and the breast cancer community about how your 
			symptoms might change day to day.  This study is unique in that it allows participants to step up as 
			equal partners in both the surveillance and management of their symptoms as well as in the research 
			process. </p>

		<h3>How this Study Works</h3>
		
		<video controls src="sharethejourney/video.m4v"></video>
		
		<p class="after-video">The Share the Journey app will ask you to answer questions about yourself, your medical history, and 
		current health. The app may ask you to perform specific tasks while using your mobile phone, such as to 
		provide a journal about your week with symptoms. To better understand the way that your symptoms are 
		affecting your life, we will ask you permission to collect data from your phone itself, such as how much 
		you move in one day.  Providing this information is optional.</p> 

		<p>Our goals are to understand the causes of the symptom variations after breast cancer treatment; to 
		learn how mobile devices and sensors can help us to these symptoms and their progression; and to ultimately 
		improve the quality of life for people after breast cancer treatment.</p>

		<p class="more-text" id="more-how">
			If you decide to join the study you will need to download the free study application on your mobile 
			device, register an account and confirm your agreement to participate in this study.  Then, periodically 
			we will ask you to answer questions and/or perform activities on your mobile phone. These questions 
			may be about your health, fatigue, mood, cognitive changes, sleep or exercise.  We will send notices 
			on your phone asking you to complete these tasks and surveys.  You may choose to act at your convenience, 
			(either then or later) and you may choose to participate in all or only in some parts of the study.  
			These tasks should take you about 20 minutes each week. You have the right to refuse to answer particular 
			questions or participate in particular aspects of the study.<br><br>

			Your study data will include your responses to surveys, your journal entries about your week with 
			symptoms and some measurements from the phone itself when you perform an activity.  A unique random code 
			will be associated with your study data instead of your name.  Your data, without your name will be added 
			to the data of other study participants and analyzed by the study team.  Also, if you choose to, your 
			study data (without your contact information) can be made available to other qualified researchers for 
			this and future research.  You will have a unique account that you can use to review your own data.
