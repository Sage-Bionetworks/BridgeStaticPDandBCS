		<h3>About this Study</h3>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Become a research partner! How can we better manage the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD) 
			together?  Sage Bionetworks (nonprofit) is proposing a new approach to monitor health in PD using 
			a mobile app. We want to understand why some people with PD have different symptoms than other 
			people with PD, and why a person’s symptoms and side effects can vary over time. The insights 
			gained from this study may help develop ideas about how to manage these differences in symptoms.</p>

			<p class="more-text" id="more-about">Living with Parkinson disease means coping with symptoms that 
			change daily. Yet these daily changes are not tracked frequently enough.  New technologies allow 
			people to record and track their health and symptoms in real time.  This study, developed in 
			concert with our advisory board, will monitor individual’s health and symptoms using questionnaires 
			and sensors via the Parkinson mPower mobile phone application and wearable devices if available. 
			This study is unique in that it allows you to step up as an equal partner in the research process.</p>

		<h3>How this Study Works</h3>
		
		<video controls src="mpower/video.m4v"></video>
		
		<p class="after-video">The mPower is a unique iPhone application that uses a mix of surveys and tasks that activate phone sensors to collect and track health and symptoms of PD progression - like dexterity, balance or gait.  
		Our goals are to learn about the variations of PD, to improve the way we describe these variations and to learn how mobile devices and sensors can help us to measure PD and its progression to ultimately improve the quality of life for people with PD.  
		This study is unique in that it allows participants to step up as equal partners in the research process.  </p>

			If you decide to join the study you will need to download the study application on your mobile device.  
			Everyone who enrolls will first complete a consent process, explaining the risks and benefits of the 
			study.  As part of this process you will also confirm your agreement to participate in this study. 
			Afterward we will ask you some questions about the study and ask you to complete the electronic 
			registration process. Registration will include entering your name, email address and other general 
			information about yourself to verify your eligibility.  Then periodically we will ask you to answer 
			questions and perform some activities via your mobile phone.  These questions may be about your health, 
			exercise, diet, sleep and medicines, in addition to other surveys.  The activities will be some brief 
			tasks that you perform while holding your phone like walking, taping or balancing for a short period 
			of time.  In addition, if you are able to sustain moderate physical activity, we may send you 
			motivational prompts to remain active. We will send notices on your phone asking you to complete 
			these tasks and surveys.  You may choose to act at your convenience, (either then or later) and you 
			may choose to participate in all or only in some parts of the study.  These tasks should take you 
			about 20 minutes each day. You have the right to refuse to answer particular questions or participate 
			in particular aspects of the study.<br><br>
			
			Your study data will include your responses to surveys and the measurements from the phone itself when 
			you perform an activity.  A unique random code will be associated with your study data instead of your 
			name.  You coded data (without your name) will be added to the data of other study participants and 
			analyzed by the study team.  Also, if you choose to, your study data (without your contact information) 
			can be made available to other qualified researchers for this and future research.  You will have a 
			unique account that you can use to review your own data.
